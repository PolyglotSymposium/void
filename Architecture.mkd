# The Architecture of Void

## User Interface
The core logic will be written in F# that is ignorant of view/UI. The view/UI
code will be written in C#. The idea is, crudely, that the C# code can be
tightly coupled to the F#, but not vice-versa.

## Other
Pending, but will imitate VsVim and other known good patterns.
