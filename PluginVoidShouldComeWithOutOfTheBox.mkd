At least a substantial subset of the features of these plugins should be
included in Void as default built-in behavior:
 + Fugitive
 + Conque - you will be able to run a terminal within Void
 + AnsiEsc - ASCII escape codes should work in terminal buffers
 + G - You should be able to `:google` from Void
 + Airline
 + Syntastic
 + Surround
 + NerdTree
 + MatchIt

Also worthy of consideration:
 + CtrlP
 + Abolish
 + Endwise
 + Gist
 + Manhunt
